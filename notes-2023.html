<h1>Data.List.Combinators: A Post-Mortem</h1>

<p>Bart Massey <br />
PL Club 2023-05-19</p>

<h2>Talk Outline</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Describe the overall project</p></li>
<li><p>Set some expectations</p></li>
<li><p>Look at the old talk in parallel with comments here</p></li>
<li><p>Pose a whole bunch of questions</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>The Data.List.Combinators Project</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>In 2012 or so I was fooling around with "fancy" combinators</p></li>
<li><p>I conceived the idea of expressing all of (pre-FTP)
<code>Data.List</code> as pure combinator functions atop a single
recursive function. It sounded like fun, so I did it
(with a bunch of help from others).</p></li>
<li><p>The goal was to produce clones with maximal laziness (per
the original, I think) and identical behavior. One barrier
was the lack of "formal" (small-F) specification of the
original. So I wrote "Laws" for most of the functions.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Project Results: Summary</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>The result was as expected: (very) slow, kind of ugly and
weird in spots, an unfixed bug</p></li>
<li><p>Was a proof of possibility; found and fixed a bug in the library
documentation </p></li>
<li><p>Exposed some possibilities for new <code>Data.List</code> functions</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>About This Work</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Never</em> run down your own skills or work at the start of a
talk. It sets a horrible expectation for the
listeners. Terrible form.</p></li>
<li><p>Having said that…</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I am not particularly competent at "modern" FP. Please
correct my many mistakes.</p></li>
<li><p>This work appears pretty naïve given current
understanding of fancy morphisms. Help appreciated.</p></li>
<li><p>There's a lot here that never got properly finished.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Cunningham's Law</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>The best way to get a right answer on the Internet is to
post a wrong answer</p></li>
<li><p>My story about this</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Reconstructing The Work: Rebuilding</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Building <code>Data.List.Combinators</code> on GHC 9 failed with a
compiler panic trying to build <code>Test.QuickCheck.Random</code>
for QuickCheck-2.14.2</p>

<pre><code>ghc: panic! (the 'impossible' happened)
  (GHC version 9.0.2:
    Ix{Int}.index: Index (2504331244) out of range ((0,821))
</code></pre>

<p>Fortunately GHC 8 worked. I am shocked at how easy it was
to clean up some minor <code>.cabal</code> issues and build without
warnings or errors.</p></li>
<li><p>Reran the benchmarks. Relative performance was similar to
2013 (GHC 5)</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Reconstructing The Work: Remembering</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Found my 2013 talk notes, thank goodness. Not sure what I
would have done otherwise.</p></li>
<li><p>Some tools and techniques I used to put the talk together
took some re-figuring. Glad I used a <code>Makefile</code>.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>2013 Talk: foldlr and lr</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Thanks to Katie Casamento for encouraging me to check out
modern morphism stuff. I found this 2014 blog post series
by Paul Thomson</p>

<p>https://blog.sumtypeofway.com/posts/introduction-to-recursion-schemes.html</p>

<p>that seems great: still digesting</p></li>
<li><p>I think <code>foldlr</code> is some standard catamorphism and <code>lr</code> is
some standard hylomorphism? Idk about <code>fold</code></p></li>
</ul>

<h2>2013 Talk: SE</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Most of the functions are built on top of the "big three":
<code>foldl</code>, <code>foldr</code>, <code>unfoldr</code>. I suspect that's partly
because of my naïvety about how the fancy functions can be
used. Is that the whole story?</p></li>
<li><p>The new functions are interesting, in the sense that maybe
they are reasonable to add. Should look into it?</p></li>
<li><p>An aside: libraries <em>very much vs</em> applications — c.f. <code>lrbench</code>.
How much can / should we expect of library authors? Of
application authors?</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>2013 Talk: Laws</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>How should Laws be specified for Haskell functions? Is
this the right "syntax"?</p></li>
<li><p>Strictness is important but I know of no good way to
specify strictness short of "maximally lazy" and some
English. Ideas?</p></li>
<li><p>Time complexity is a bit ill-defined for Haskell? Or no?
Laziness makes reasoning about it confusing.</p></li>
<li><p>Space complexity is a problem. Any good way to get insight
on memory usage for "garbage cons cells" or similar?</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>2013 Talk: Lazy Pattern Matching</h2>

<ul>
<li>Is this an actual issue? I don't think folks "normally" teach
lazy matching to new Haskell users, although I think our
FP course covers it</li>
</ul>

<h2>Performance?</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Does performance matter here? Are there ways to make the
whole structure more performant?</p></li>
<li><p>How much of the performance problem is just my lack of
understanding of Haskell operational semantics? Can we
reasonably expect such understanding from "line programmers"?</p></li>
<li><p>Is the lazy matching part of the performance issue?</p></li>
<li><p>How much should we expect GHC to be able to do for us
going forward?</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>FTP?</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Post this work, the "Functional Traversable Proposal" was
adopted for <code>Data.List</code>, making it more <code>Data.FT</code></p></li>
<li><p>Was this good or am I wrong? Change my mind: making
<code>Maybe</code> FT is more of a footgun than a feature</p></li>
<li><p>How would this affect continuing this project?</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Is This A Thing?</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>"I did a thing"</p></li>
<li><p>Is there anything here worth continuing / salvaging?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Probably some kind of laws, I think. Proofs?</p></li>
<li><p>Maybe continued GHC improvements for combinators, but
this seems to be incredibly hard?</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Freaking Eloi and Morlocs</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>c.f. <em>The Time Machine</em>. I am not an H.G. Wells fan. Maybe
Architects and Builders?</p></li>
<li><p>"Avoid success at any cost" has been incredibly successful</p></li>
<li><p>ChatGPT programming vs brilliant elegant programming?</p></li>
</ul>
