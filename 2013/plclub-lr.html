<h1>A General Linear Recursion Operator vs Data.List</h1>

<h2>A WIP Story</h2>

<p>This story goes back a ways. In 2010</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I get interested in <code>Data.List.mapAccumL</code>, because it appears to
be not obviously expressible as <code>foldl</code> or <code>foldr</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The key seems to be that it carries data from the left like
<code>foldl</code> (the "accumL" part), but should be implemented
like <code>map</code> with a <code>foldr</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Jamey Sharp, Julian Kongslie and I become interested in
whether there's some kind of "both ways at once" fold that would
apply here: laziness seems to make it possible.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Introducing <code>foldlr</code></h2>

<p>After some messing around, the thing that the types kind of
force seems to make sense:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>While traversing the list from the left, carry along
a left accumulator. Have it "meet" an accumulator "travelling
from the right", that will be started when the end of the
list is reached.</p></li>
<li><p>Thus, this fold can make use of some information from
the past, and some "from the future", thanks to laziness.</p></li>
<li><p>The result looks like <a href="foldlr.hs.html">this</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Some properties of <code>foldlr</code></h2>

<ul>
<li><p><code>foldl</code> and <code>foldr</code> are trivially
<a href="foldlr.hs.html">implementable</a> as <code>foldlr</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>mapAccumL</code> is implementable as <code>foldlr</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Strictness of <code>foldlr</code> depends on strictness of folding
function <code>f</code>: strict if <code>f</code> is strict on at most one of
the right or left accumulator, bottom if <code>f</code> is strict on
both.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Related Work</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Noah Easterly's
"<a href="http://haskell.1045720.n5.nabble.com/Bifold-a-simultaneous-foldr-and-foldl-td3285581.html">bifold</a>"
from Haskell-Cafe is identical up to trivial signature
differences</p></li>
<li><p>I do not understand whether Henning Theielemann's
"foldl'r" discussed there is the same.</p></li>
<li><p>Probably others also.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>An SE Plan</h2>

<p>I've always liked the idea of supercombinator
programming. In particular, the promise of getting rid of
non-sequential control flow is that it intuitively seems
likely to get rid of control flow bugs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>gotos &#8594; loops &#8594; recursion &#8594; nothing</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Parts of <code>Data.List</code> are written in terms of each other, but
a lot are "optimized" loops. Try rewriting everything in
terms of <code>foldlr</code>?</p>

<h2>(Notational Switch)</h2>

<p>An aside: the type signature and usage of <code>foldlr</code> is kind
ugly. After some messing around, I ended up with
<a href="foldlr.hs.html">this</a> <code>fold</code>.</p>

<h2><code>Data.List.Combinator</code> -- The Big Rewrite</h2>

<p>Some months later I had a working copy of <code>Data.List</code>
rewritten in terms of <code>fold</code>, <code>unfoldr</code>, and one data
recursion (<code>cycle</code>).</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The rewrite was a sort of "cheat". In several places
(<code>transpose</code> and <code>sort</code> come to mind) I constructed an
internal list whose sole purpose was structural, to run
<code>fold</code> over. The list contents were ignored or marginally
useful.</p></li>
<li><p>Having <code>unfoldr</code> lying around separately seemed no good.</p></li>
<li><p>Started to expose one possible set of dependencies between
<code>Data.List</code> functions.</p></li>
<li><p>Added about 25 functions for completeness, orthogonality,
general goodness: total about 135 functions.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Laws</h2>

<p>To try to ensure that I was doing the rewrite fairly, I
constructed "laws" for almost all functions in <code>Data.List</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Also specified complexity and strictness.</p></li>
<li><p>Laws (and code) were constructed solely from the
documentation.</p></li>
<li><p>Did some very minimal verification that some laws held for
both versions.</p></li>
<li><p>Found one fairly glaring bug in the documentation, in
<a href="Data-List-Combinator.hs.html">insertBy</a>.
(<a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/7421">Bug #7421</a>,
now fixed).</p></li>
<li><p>Some laws are missing, likely still buggy.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Phase 2: Now With Even More Supercombinators</h2>

<p>Over the recent Christmas break I started getting interested
in what cleanups were possible. I started thinking about the
general structure of linear recursion, and decided that the
list argument of <code>fold</code> is unnecessary.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Constructed a more general
<a href="Data-List-Combinator.hs.html">operator</a> <code>lr</code>, for
"linear recursion" (stupid name?), which handwavingly
generalizes any linear recursive function.</p></li>
<li><p>Constructed by essentially ripping the list out of <code>fold</code>,
leaving only the structure. This means that a way to stop
recursing was desirable; a <code>Maybe</code> on the right argument
did the trick.</p></li>
<li><p>The result looks more like <code>unfold</code>, and for a while I
called it that.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>The Power of <code>lr</code></h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Provides "natural" (?) implementations of <code>fold</code>, and of
<code>unfoldr</code> and <code>unfoldl</code> (just ignoring left or right as
with <code>foldl</code> and <code>foldr</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>Contrast with <code>fix</code>, which does a sort of
"Recursion-removal In Name Only" <a href="foldlr.hs.html">RINO</a>".</p></li>
<li><p>Contrast with <code>fold</code>, which is stuck down to lists.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>The Structure of <code>Data.List.Combinator</code></h2>

<p>It is interesting to look at the
<a href="graph/graph.svg">dependency graph</a>
of the resulting <code>Data.List.Combinator</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Of course, this is only one possible way of doing
things. My Haskell skills are not so leet...</p></li>
<li><p>Note how much of the library is in terms of just a few
primitive functions.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Some Lazy Pattern Matches</h2>

<p>In several places, pattern matches had to be made "lazy" (~
operator) to get strictness right.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Typical case was an "irrefutable" pattern match: wanted to
be deferred for laziness because there was only one way it
could match. e.g. in <code>transpose</code></p>

<pre><code>g ~(y : ys) (h, t) = (y : h, ys : t)
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Maybe this should be implicit?  I had nice discussions
with Tim Sheard and Mark Jones about this. They both think
that this is fine.</p></li>
<li><p>Mark actually managed to convince me for a while.</p>

<pre><code> f ~[_] = 3


 &gt;&gt;&gt; f []
 3
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Now I am not convinced again: this seems OK to me.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>One Strictness Bug</h2>

<p>There is one known outright strictness bug. There are probably
many others.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Bug manifests in <code>take</code>.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; take 1 $ insertBy compare 2 [1, undefined]
[1*** Exception: Prelude.undefined
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Seems like something deep, and I can't find it.</p></li>
<li><p>Strange behavior in that take "shouldn't be able to do that".</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Performance Sucks</h2>

<p>The performance of all this? The same 30x slower that was
reported last week. And probably for the same reasons.</p>

<ul>
<li>Did some Criterion <a href="benchmarks.html">benchmarks</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Work In Progress</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Fix known bugs.</p></li>
<li><p>Find or write <code>Data.List</code> QuickCheck or similar tests.</p></li>
<li><p>Use a strictness tester to find more strictness bugs.</p></li>
<li><p>Nail down the rest of the Laws.</p></li>
<li><p>Experiment with actual proofs in this structure.</p></li>
<li><p>Make performance acceptable if possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Figure out how to fuse <code>lr</code> calls.</p></li>
</ul>
